I am Shane Million, legend of lore, first of his name, unusal fellow with too much free time.

No but in all seriousness, I am 35 years old, I am working on my third degree (Computer Science)

I have been in the technology realm for about 10 years and I feel I would be excellent at programming.

I am currently serving as a QA Analyst, performing unit tests and using tools like Smart Bear's Test Complete for automated tests.

I love baseball, food, and the History Channel.
